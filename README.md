### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Whilst the labs did prepare us, I found myelf having to do a lot of outside research to complete the basic features required.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

If I had more time, I would definitley add more to the home page and add more transition and hover effects.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Honestly for my first project I am quite happy with how everything turned out. The website turned out how I envisioned it aesthetically.
